This is the very early stages of a wrapper for IUP.

It has been tested only on Windows but should work on Linux/Unix
systems fairly easy. You will need to edit the lip slot iup.li and
add the correct library definitions for your OS. That should be
all that is necessary.

To compile this on Windows, you need to download the Iup, Cd and Img
libraries for your version of MinGW. Place the libraries into your
MinGW/lib directory and the include files into your MinGW/include
directory.

You can test the interface by compiling and running the example:

  lisaac example.li

When complete, this will be an entire wrapping around Iup, Cd and Img
complete with a fully Object Oriented interface.
