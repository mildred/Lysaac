WARNING

This is esperimental software only.
It provides a binding for the Lua programming language.
All lua functions that work on a lua_State are slots of LUA_STATE.
But be sure to read the source code to see if the function exists. Not all
functions are bound. and if you add support for others functions, please try to
keep the source code coherent and send me the changes you made so I can include
it.

The licence is the MIT licence as specified in the source files. It is the same
licence as Lua, so you shouldn't have any problem using it.

You will need to link the resulting object file with the lua library. Usually,
this is done by adding the -llua flag to the gcc command line.
