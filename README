You can:

    git clone -b mildred-stable git://anonscm.debian.org/lisaac/compiler.git lisaac-compiler

You will also need redo: https://github.com/apenwarr/redo

If you don't want to install redo, you can always use `tools/do` instead if
`redo` in all the commands.

Compiling
=========

    redo all

Testing
=======

Basically, you need [cucumber](http://cukes.info) and rspec, but you can also
follow the guide:

- Install bundler: `gem install bundler`

- Install the necessary gems: `bundle install`

For coverage reports, you'll need the Perl Template Toolkit: `Template.pm`

Then, just:

    redo tests
    redo coverage

Reports are in the `reports` directory. You can see code coverage.

If you get wierd errors, just `rvm reset`
