You will also need redo: https://github.com/apenwarr/redo

If you don't want to install redo, you can always use `tools/do` instead if
`redo` in all the commands.

Compiling
=========

    redo all

Testing
=======

You need `ruby`, `rubygems` and the `bundler` gem (`gem install bundler`).
In the project, run `bundle install`, it should install everything you need.
Then:

    cucumber

Then, just

    redo tests
    redo coverage

Reports are in the `reports` directory. You can see code coverage.
