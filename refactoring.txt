REG should not store TYPE directly, the constructor should extract BAST_TYPE.
REG.is_valid should test if the base_type is not void (we should test this against regressions and revert if not applicable).

INSTR_FNPTR should be renamed INSTR_GLOBAL and every time a global value is required, it should use this instruction.
