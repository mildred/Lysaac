REG.type:TYPE should be REG.basic_type:BASIC_TYPE

Is REG.writer_instruction useful? Remove!

ITM_EXPR.compile_in (??)

INSTR_STORE should be symmetric of INSTR_LOAD
  - INSTR_LOAD is only for local variables
  - for data slots, they are considered as code slot anyway, so INSTR_CALL is used
  - INSTR_STORE should work primarily for local variables
  - current INSTR_STORE could either:
    - support both variables and data slots
    - support only variables and data slots are managed elsewhere
